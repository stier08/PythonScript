    This whole schenanigans is necessary, as you can't call PyGILState_Ensure() from a thread that already has the GIL.

    For the ScintillaWrapper (specifically, but not exclusively), it's tricky to impossible to tell if we need to release the GIL. If we're running on the 
    Python worker thread, and we make a call to Scintilla, that triggers a callback, we need to give it up (in order that the callback can run).  The callback
    identification must be performed with the GIL, so it would block if we didn't give it up. (There's an optimisation that if no callbacks are registered, then it
    doesn't check, and doesn't acquire the GIL)
	
	However, if we're being called from the replace function, and therefore the main thread, we probably don't even have the GIL to give up.
	
	With the different threads running the different callbacks, and python code running on a thread (*generally* - see the editor.replace() suite)
    it has become impossible to manage manually (read: the Wrong Way To Do It(tm)).  These objects manage the GIL, and provide a easy, safe way to ensure 
	you have the GIL when you need it, and give it up correctly whatever happens in the mean time.

    The doIHaveTheGIL() function is taken from Python 3.4.0, Issue #17522. An extra workaround is included to make it work when Py_DEBUG is defined.
    - see note below where PyThreadState_GET is redefined.
